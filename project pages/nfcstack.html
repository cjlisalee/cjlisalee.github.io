                                    <p>We present NFCStack, a physical building blocks system that supportsboth stacking and interaction based on near-field communication (NFC). The system consists of a portable station that can support and resolve the order of three types of passive identifiable  stackables: brick, block, and adapter. The bricks support stable and sturdy physical construction, whereas the blocks support effortless tangible interactions. The adapter  provides an interface between the two types of stackables and turns the top of a stack into terminals for detecting the interaction events of NFC-tagged objects. Compared with the previous systems based on NFC or radio-frequency identification (RFID) technologies, the NFCStack system is portable, supports simultaneous interactions, and resolves the stacking and interaction events responsively even when the objects are not strictly aligned. A series of evaluation results show the system effectively supports a full-stack, 12 layers of rich-ID stacking with the three types of blocks, even if every block is stacked on each other with a 6mm offset. Based on the evaluation results, we also illuminate possible generalizations such as extending this system from stacking to 2.5D construction. With our proof-of-conceptimplementation, we demonstrate the interaction styles through several educational application examples and discuss the design implications for future research.</p>
