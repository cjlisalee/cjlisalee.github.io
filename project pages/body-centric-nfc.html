                                    <p>NFC (Near-Field Communication) has been widely applied for human-computer interaction (HCI). However, the short sensing distance of NFC requires the users to initiate the tasks with extra effort mostly using their hands, so it is inconvenient to use NFC in hands-busy scenarios. This paper presents an investigation of body-centric interactions between the NFC device users and their surroundings. The exploration is based on the recent development of near-field enabled clothing, which can passively extend an NFC-enabled device’s reading distance to users’ body landmarks. We present an accessible method for fabricating flexible, extensible, and scalable NFC extenders on clothing pieces, and an easy-to-use toolkit for facilitating designers to realize the interactive experiences. The method and toolkit were tested in technical experiments and in a co-creation workshop. The elicited design outcomes and the further exploratory makings generated knowledge for future research and embodied interaction design opportunities.</p>
